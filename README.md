Repository for the bonus app to automate a decision process for the individual choice of the appropriate cross-platform framework. A choice can be made between React Native, Flutter, Kotlin Multiplatform and Vue.js.

This app is developed using Flutter because that should be the appropriate framework using the decision process proposed in my [master's thesis](https://github.com/AnleAnja/masterthesis).
